## Quick Asset Priority List

If you're launching ads in the next 24 hours and have limited time, create IN THIS ORDER:

1. **Before/After Split (30 min)** → Highest converting static image format
2. **Terminal Screenshot (15 min)** → Shows the actual product
3. **Customer Pain Illustration (20 min)** → Emotion-driven, good for cold traffic

Video can wait until Week 2 once you validate the concept.

## Design Tips for High-Ticket Conversion

✅ **DO:**
- Use professional fonts (Inter, Poppins, Montserrat)
- Keep it clean and minimal (not cluttered)
- Use high contrast (dark bg + white text or vice versa)
- Include the price "€2,000" (anchors expectations)
- Show time savings visually ("3 seconds" vs "2 minutes")

❌ **DON'T:**
- Use comic sans or unprofessional fonts
- Cram too much text (mobile users can't read small text)
- Use stock photos of fake "tech" (circuits, matrix code, etc.)
- Hide the price (high-ticket buyers want to know upfront)
- Use clickbait (damages trust)

---

## Color Palette (From Landing Page)

Use these colors for consistency:

- **Primary Purple:** `#667eea`
- **Accent Pink:** `#f5576c`
- **Dark Gray:** `#1e1e1e` (terminal background)
- **Success Green:** `#10b981`
- **White:** `#ffffff`
- **Text Gray:** `#6b7280`
