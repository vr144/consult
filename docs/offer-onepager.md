# Offer: Shopify Ops Command Center (Cursor Install)

## Outcome

In 48 hours, you can **query your Shopify store inside Cursor** to instantly answer:

- “Where is order #1234 and what’s the status?”
- “Has this customer ordered before?”
- “What products were updated recently?”

This replaces tab-switching and reduces mistakes during daily ops.

## Deliverable (v1)

I guide you on a screenshare to install a private local connector (MCP) that adds these tools to Cursor:

- Search orders
- Get order details
- Search customers / get customer
- List products

Read-only by default (safe).

## Pricing

**€2,000 — or €0 if we can’t get it installed** (per acceptance checklist).

## What you need

- Shopify admin access (to create an Admin API token)
- A laptop where you can install Node.js
- 90 minutes screenshare + 30 minutes acceptance testing

## What counts as “installed”

You can successfully run the acceptance checklist in `docs/acceptance-checklist.md`.

## Optional add-ons (after v1)

- HubSpot or Pipedrive sync (+€1,500)
- Katana inventory/production flows (+€2,500+ depending on complexity)
- Ongoing maintenance and new actions (€300–€800/mo)
