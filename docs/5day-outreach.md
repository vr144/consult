# 5-day plan to close 1× €2,000 install

Goal: close **one** Shopify operator who already uses (or is willing to use) Cursor.

## Day 1: Build target list (50–100)

Prioritize:
- Small teams (1–10 people) where the operator is the owner
- Higher order volume stores (they feel the pain)
- Tech-forward brands (already using HubSpot/Pipedrive, Notion, Slack, etc.)

Where to find:
- LinkedIn: “Founder” + “Shopify” + country
- Shopify-focused agency portfolios (their clients)
- Local ecommerce communities

## Day 2: Outreach (30–50 messages)

Message (short):
“Hey — I set up a private connector that lets you query Shopify inside Cursor (orders/customers/products) so you stop tab-switching. I can guide the install in 2 hours. €2k or free if we can’t get it installed. Want a 10 min demo?”

## Day 3: Demos (3–6)

Run the demo script, qualify hard, book installs.

## Day 4: Installs (1–2)

Get one installed, collect testimonial + referral.

## Day 5: Upsell + referrals

Pitch add-on:
- Shopify + HubSpot/Pipedrive
- Inventory workflows
