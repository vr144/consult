# Sales call script (15–20 minutes)

## 1) Qualify fast (3 minutes)

“Do you personally do ops inside Shopify admin most days?”
“Do you use Cursor already?”
“Do you have Shopify admin rights to create an API token?”

Hard stop if: they don’t use Cursor and won’t, or they can’t create tokens, or they want refunds/product edits on day 1.

## 2) Pain + impact (5 minutes)

Ask:
- “How many orders/week?”
- “How often do you need to answer ‘where is my order’ or check customer history?”
- “How many tools/tabs do you switch between?”
- “What mistakes cost you money today (late replies, wrong stock decisions, missed repeat customers)?”

## 3) Demo (5 minutes)

Show 3 things only:
- search an order by email → open order details
- fetch customer by email → show order count
- list products → show last updated

Avoid anything write-related in v1.

## 4) Offer + guarantee (3 minutes)

“€2,000. We do a guided install. If we can’t complete the acceptance checklist, you pay €0.”

Then immediately clarify preconditions:
- must have admin access
- must install Node
- must allocate 2 hours in one sitting

## 5) Close (2 minutes)

“If we book the install for tomorrow, can you confirm you’ll have Shopify admin access on the call?”
