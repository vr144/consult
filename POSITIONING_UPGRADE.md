### Discovery Questions:
1. "What tasks eat up the most time for your team each week?"

3. "How do you currently handle bulk updates across hundreds of products?"
4. "Do you sync data between Shopify and other systems manually?"
5. "What would it be worth to cut a 2-week project down to 30 minutes?"
